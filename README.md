# Weight Converter GUI using Tkinter

## Overview
This Python project provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) application for converting weights from kilograms (KG) to grams, pounds, and ounces. It is built using the Tkinter library, a standard GUI toolkit in Python.

## Features
- Converts the input weight in kilograms to grams, pounds, and ounces.
- Simple and intuitive user interface.
- Easy to understand and modify the code.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Dependencies
The project relies on the Tkinter library, which is included with Python by default. No additional installation is required.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/weight-converter.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd weight-converter
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the `weight_converter_gui.py` file:
   ```bash
   python weight_converter_gui.py
   ```
2. Enter the weight in kilograms in the provided input field.
3. Click the "Convert" button to see the converted weights in grams, pounds, and ounces.

## Example
Suppose you want to convert 5 kilograms:
- Input: 5
- Grams: 5000
- Pounds: 11.0231
- Ounces: 176.37

## How It Works
1. The GUI is created using Tkinter, with input fields for the user to enter the weight in kilograms.
2. When the user clicks the "Convert" button, the `from_kg()` function is triggered.
3. The `from_kg()` function calculates the equivalent weight in grams, pounds, and ounces based on the input.
4. The results are displayed in the respective output fields on the GUI.
